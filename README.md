# CodebaseNotes

A VS Code extension that allows you to annotate your codebase's files AND folders directly on a project tree in the VS Code UI. The goal is to help developers and teams maintain clear documentation about the structure and purpose of different parts of their codebase. Also serves as a great tool for onboarding or just personal learning. All notes are stored into a single json file that can be checked into a repo.
