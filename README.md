# CodebaseNotes

A VS Code extension that allows you to annotate your codebase's files AND folders directly on a project tree in the VS Code UI. Maintain clear documentation about the structure and purpose of the different parts of your codebase. Also serves as a great tool for onboarding or just personal learning. All notes are stored into a single json file that can be checked into a repo.
